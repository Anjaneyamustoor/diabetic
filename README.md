# glaucoma-detector
Always remember that tensorflow does not support python 3.8. It supports upto version 3.7 only.

To run our glaucoma detector,
1)Install all the required packages from requirements.txt manually or type "pip install -r requirements.txt" in terminal or cmd
2)Type "streamlit run glaucoma_app.py" in your terminal or cmd
3)The web app opens up in a local host

Then upload a (jpg) fundus image of eye. Our model predicts whether affected by glaucoma or not.

Note: The image should be cropped around the optic nerve part.....not full fundus image.
